# 📑 Master BRD: WhatsApp Business Intelligence & Compliance Platform

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Vision
Build the **“Stripe + GitHub for WhatsApp Templates”** — a compliance-first, AI-powered platform that makes the WhatsApp Business Cloud API usable, safe, and intelligent.

### Mission
- Solve **foundational template pain points** (UI, collaboration, compliance, insights).
- Add **AI intelligence** for pre-validation, auto-fix, and predictive analytics.
- Expand into **automation, workflows, and AI-driven optimization**.

---

## 2. Strategic Pivot

Instead of heavy automation upfront, Phase 1 focuses on **foundational pain points** every WhatsApp Business faces.

**Current Reality:**
- Terrible WhatsApp Manager UI.
- No team collaboration, version control, or compliance monitoring.
- High rejection rates (67%).
- No performance insights.
- Confusing webhook setup.

**Solution:**
Think **“GitHub for WhatsApp Templates”** + **“Compliance Guard”** + **“Intelligent Wrapper”**.
